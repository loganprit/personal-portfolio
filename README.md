# Personal Portfolio

A modern, minimalist portfolio site built with HTML5 UP's Dimension template, representing the second iteration of my personal portfolio. Features a responsive, modal-based layout enhanced with smooth transitions and dynamic backgrounds. This version was chosen specifically to explore SASS/SCSS styling capabilities. Future version 3 planned with React and TypeScript implementation.

## Overview

- Single-page design with modal "pages"
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Smooth transitions and depth effects
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Background blur effects on modal activation
